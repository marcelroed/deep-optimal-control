# Deep Optimal Control
## Description
Implementations of ideas discussed in "Deep Learning as Optimal Control Problems: Models and Numerical Methods".

## Setup
1. Install [Git](https://https://git-scm.com) and [Python 3](https://www.python.org) if you don't already have them.

2. Open a terminal window, and navigate to the folder in which you want to keep the repository. Note that Git will create a new directory called `deep-optimal-control` in this location.

3. Clone the repository from GitHub
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/marcelroed/deep-optimal-control
```

4. Install Python requirements
```sh
$ cd deep-optimal-control
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You should now be able to run `main.py` with Python.
